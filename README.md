## Trainer Tool

**Trainer-Tool** is a way to keep a Gym trainer and their students connected and working towards their goal. The ability to keep trianers connected even when not is very important and is what we have done and will continue to expand with time.

## Tecnologys

We used the MEAN stack to develop this web site. We also used the Google maps API to help locate the traines and connect with one the fits your  schedule and location.
## Motivation

Our motivation for this is that when working with a trainer twice a week, some times you are left wondering what to do when he/she is not there with you. Maybe your trainer Writes it all down or prints it out for you, but we know that it does not work all the time for many reasons. We do know that most of us will carry our phone with us either for music or to stay connected. Well with the **Trainer-Tool** the trainer will be able to assign a work out and give the client a digital way to keep it with them at all time.
