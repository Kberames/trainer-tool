Project Description
    This application will help clients find personal trainers in their area.  Once a trainer and client are connected, personal trainers will be able to create workout plans and assign them to their clients.  The app will use Google Maps API to locate trainers on a map near a client's location.

User = client
user.trainer = trainer
user.admin = admin
